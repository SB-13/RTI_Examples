# RTI_Examples

This holds example for RTI. They are simple and show that RTI Connext DDS can communicate over Wi-Fi to different computers (i.e. from a Raspberry Pi to an Ubuntu VM).

Note that the Ubuntu VM that you are using must have a Wi-Fi adpater that is mounted so that it can join the wireless network that is available. The VM will treat the wireless connection that you have on your laptop (i.e. Windows box) as a WIRED connection and will NOT allow for communication over Wi-Fi. This will caus RTI Connext DDS to not work properly. So make sure that you have a wireless adapter and connect your VM to Wi-Fi properly. If you have questions or need help, please contact Garrett Lender.
