RTI example for Java. You can run the publisher/subscriber on an Ubuntu VM by running either of the following commands:

make -f makefile_shape_x64Linux3gcc4.8.2 ShapeTypePublisher
OR 
make -f makefile_shape_x64Linux3gcc4.8.2 ShapeTypeSubscriber

Note, the VM can be either the publisher or subscriber. Also, make sure that the Raspberry Pi runs the other. For example, if the VM is running the Subscriber then the Pi should be running the Publisher.

This will allow you to see that RTI Connext DDS is communicating over Wi-Fi from the VM to the Raspberry Pi.
